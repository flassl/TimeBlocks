MVP:
    - Tasks can not cover one another nor get dropped on top og each other
    - On_Deployment: the database does not get overwritten after updating app
    - Dragging- / Stretching & Scroll functionality

Debug:
    - Weak reference crash on switching screens in planner and calendar
    - Task respawns in other position after dragging starts
    - Touch up does not come through in navigation drawer
     -> fast/ double-clicking on task list
    - Weired backspin of fab when opening (because of task animation?)

Details:
    - Task positioning hint disappears when hovering with a dragged task over the FAB
    - Show days of previous and last month in the calendar.

Luxury:
    - Add checkable milestones to tasks
    - implement repeat functionality in events
